# Welcome to My Documentation Site

Welcome! This is my centralized documentation site for all things related to my home lab, network configurations, and technical notes.

## Why This Site?

Before setting up this site, my notes were scattered across:
- Cloud note-taking apps
- Private Git repositories
- Local text files
- Various documentation tools

Now everything is in one place - **fast, secure, and easy to maintain**.

## Features

This documentation site provides:

- **Fast**: Static site generation means blazing fast load times
- **Secure**: No database or admin backend to manage
- **Simple**: Write in Markdown, deploy automatically
- **Beautiful**: Clean, minimal design with dark mode support
- **Search**: Built-in search functionality
- **Organized**: Categories and tags for easy navigation

## What You'll Find Here

This site contains documentation on:

- Home lab configurations
- Network diagrams and documentation
- Installation and configuration guides
- Container and service setups
- System restoration procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- And much more!

## Getting Started
